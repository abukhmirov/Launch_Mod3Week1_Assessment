## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
 HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the way computers can interact with each other on the Internet. It is important because computers need the structure and security of HTTP to comunicate with each other through Client-Server communication.
2. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible)

3. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
 The verb and the path. The verb is what we actually want the response to do, like show us some info(GET) or delete info somewhere(DELETE). The "somewhere" is the path. It is the location or the destination of the request.
4. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
  If the program is a dish, then HTML is the ingredients and CSS is the presentation of them on the plate. 
5. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?
 They show the html and css of the web page you are on. This can provide an insight at better page creation and show how the structure of a website should look.
6. How do you open the chrome dev tools?
Shift-Ctrl-i or Right Click and Inspect or f12
7. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
For better readability by others, better searchability (chrome will show your website more if it knows where to look for clues about what your website is)
8. What are the three components of the box model?
Content, Padding, Border, and Margin (4 components?)
